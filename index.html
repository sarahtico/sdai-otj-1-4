        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p> What's so great about combining the worlds of coding and cuisine? Dev Dish was founded by two passionate
            developers who turned their love for software into a culinary adventure. After years of coding by day and
            cooking by
            night, they decided to merge their two passions and create something extraordinary.

        <p> Dev Dish brings a unique twist to the food truck scene, offering a menu full of creative, tech-inspired
            dishes.
            Whether you're a tech enthusiast or a food lover, our offerings are designed to satisfy both your appetite
            and
            your
            curiosity.</p>

        <p> Dev Dish is the brainchild of Alex and Jamie, two friends who met at a hackathon and discovered a shared
            love
            for
            innovative cuisine. With a background in software development and a knack for culinary creativity, they
            embarked
            on
            a journey to deliver delicious, tech-themed dishes to the community.</p>
