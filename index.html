    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p> What's so great about combining the worlds of coding and cuisine? Dev Dish was founded by two passionate
        developers who turned their love for software into a culinary adventure. After years of coding by day and
        cooking by
        night, they decided to merge their two passions and create something extraordinary.

    <p> Dev Dish brings a unique twist to the food truck scene, offering a menu full of creative, tech-inspired dishes.
        Whether you're a tech enthusiast or a food lover, our offerings are designed to satisfy both your appetite and
        your
        curiosity.</p>

    <p> Dev Dish is the brainchild of Alex and Jamie, two friends who met at a hackathon and discovered a shared love
        for
        innovative cuisine. With a background in software development and a knack for culinary creativity, they embarked
        on
        a journey to deliver delicious, tech-themed dishes to the community.</p>
